# My personal website

Created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Commands are specified in the [`Justfile`](Justfile) and can be listed by running [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

## Code hightlight

The CSS for the code highlights was generated with the following command:

```
rougify style monokai.sublime > assets/css/code.css
```

But with the background colors removed.

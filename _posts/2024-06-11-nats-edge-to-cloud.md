[NATS](https://nats.io/) describes itself as _Connective Technology_. At it's core, it's a messaging platform. And with NATS JetStream it provides a persistence layer on top of it.

Getting started with NATS can be done via:

- [Screencasts](https://www.synadia.com/screencasts).
- [NATS by example](https://natsbyexample.com/)
- [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/)

In this blog post series I want to explore the appliance of NATS in an edge-to-cloud scenario, e.g. a smart home gateway (edge) connected to a central cloud server.

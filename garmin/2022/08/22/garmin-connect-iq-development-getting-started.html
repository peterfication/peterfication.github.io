  <p>I recently got a Garmin Smartwatch and I thought it would be interesting to get to know it as well from a development platform perspective. First, I tried to find resources and examples online to get a grasp of Garmin Connect IQ development. This is how my <a href="https://github.com/peterfication/awesome-garmin-connect-iq">Awesome List Garmin Connect IQ</a> started.</p>

<p>While searching for how to get started, I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@JoshuaTheMiller/making-a-watchface-for-garmin-devices-8c3ce28cae08">this post from 2018 from Joshua Miller</a> which explains how to get started with Garmin Connect IQ development back then with Eclipse. It seemed simple so I was eager to create a simple Garmin Watchface myself. However, I wasn’t looking forward to install Eclipse …</p>

<p>To my pleasant surprise, while reading through the install steps on the Garmin IQ website, I found out that Eclipse is a thing of the past when talking about Garmin Connect IQ development. Now, everything is set up to work with Visual Studio Code. Event though I mostly work with Vim, this is ok for a small project, at least for starting with it.</p>

<p>I have to say, Garmin did a very good job on their documentation and developer experience! This means, my article is not really long.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install VS Code</li>
  <li>Walk through the <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/getting-started">“Getting started” page</a> from Garmin</li>
  <li>Walk through the <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/your-first-app/">“Your first app” page</a> from Garmin</li>
</ol>

<p>And then you already have a simulated watchface on your machine.</p>

<p>One final tip for getting started: The location on a Mac of the official samples from the SDK are here:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/Library/Application Support/Garmin/ConnectIQ/Sdks/{YOUR_CURRENT_SDK}.
</code></pre></div></div>
